# AndroidIDE Version v2.7.0-beta Changelog

This patch release is all about publishing AndroidIDE on F-Droid, while delivering some minor fixes.

## Important notes

- AndroidIDE is now available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.itsaky.androidide/)!

- F-Droid builds of AndroidIDE has a different signature and hence, you cannot install those builds
  over existing GitHub builds of AndroidIDE. This means that if you have AndroidIDE installaled from
  GitHub and if you try to update the app by installing a version downloaded from F-Droid,
  it won't be installed. The same is true for installing GitHub builds over F-Droid ones.
